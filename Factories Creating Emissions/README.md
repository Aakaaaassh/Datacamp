# Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions

In this introductory project, you are interested in the recent carbon emissions of each industry in <code>product_emissions</code> and decide to look at carbon emissions by different industries from the most recent year within the database.

* In the first SQL cell, find the most recent year that data on carbon emissions was collected.
* In the second SQL cell, write a query that returns a table of each <code>industry_group</code> along with the number of companies that are in that industry and a total of the PCFs for that industry, rounded to one decimal place, filtering for the most recent year that data was collected.
  * Please name the three columns <code>industry_group</code>, <code>num_companies</code>, and <code>total_industry_footprint</code>.
  * Present your results in order from the highest emitting industries to the lowest emitting industries.
