here are the list of commands along with the queries in Double quotes to execute those commands successfully.


1) it returns all the data from the table nomnom

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom;
"""

2) It returns all the DIstinct neighborhood From the table

"""
SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood
FROM nomnom;
"""

3) It returns all the DIstinct Cuisine From the table

"""
SELECT DISTINCT cuisine

"""

4) Suppose we would like some Chinese takeout.
What are our options?

"""
SELECT *

WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese';
"""

5) the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.

"""
SELECT *

WHERE review >= 4;
"""

6) Suppose anyone want to have a fancy dinner date. Return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
   AND price = '$$$';
"""

If you want to find Italian restaurants with at least three dollar signs:

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
   AND price LIKE '%$$$%';
"""

7) Your coworker can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘meatball’ in it.

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE name LIKE '%meatball%';
"""

8) Find all the close by spots in Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown'
   OR neighborhood = 'Downtown'
   OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown'; 
"""

9) Find all the health grade pending restaurants (empty values).

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE health IS NULL;
"""

10) Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on reviews.

Using ORDER BY and the DESC keyword, we can sort the restaurants by ratings from highest to lowest:

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC;
"""

Then, include a LIMIT to cap it at 10:

"""
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 10;
"""

11) Use a CASE statement to change the rating system to:

review > 4.5 is Extraordinary
review > 4 is Excellent
review > 3 is Good
review > 2 is Fair
Everything else is Poor
Don’t forget to rename the new column!

"""
SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN review > 4.5 THEN 'Extraordinary'
  WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
  WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
  WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
  ELSE 'Poor'
 END AS 'Review'
FROM nomnom;
"""

Here, the column is renamed to ‘Review’ using AS.
