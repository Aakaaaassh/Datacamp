### The World Bank's international debt data
It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this notebook, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?


The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

### Project Tasks
1. What is the number of distinct countries present in the database? The output should be single column aliased with the following name: total_distinct_countries.
2. What are the distinct debt indicators? the output column should be aliased as distinct_debt_indicators and the outputs should be ordered by it.
3. What is the total amount of debt owed by all the countries present in the table? The output should be single column aliased with the following name: total_debt.
4. What country has the highest amount of debt?
5. What is the average amount of debt across different debt indicators?
6. What is the highest amount of principal repayments in the "DT.AMT.DLXF.CD" category?
